# Human_Aware_Localization_System
ENPM700-MidTerm Project

## Phase 0

- Driver: Bhavana B Rao
- Navigator: Sriram Kothapalli

This project aims to design and develop a Human Aware Localization Module for Acme's autonomous robotic systems. Phase 0 involves proposing the design, the work flow, and the software development process for the project.

The proposal document and QuadChart is located in the proposal directory. The proposal document outlines the design and development of the HALS system. It discusses the design process, technologies, and algorithms that will be used, along with the testing and validation steps. It also identifies potential risks and mitigation strategies, ensuring a clear path toward high-quality deliverables. Additionally, the document describes the team's structure, pair programming approach, and final deliverables.

The quadchart is a concise, one-page graphical summary used to present key information about a project or proposal. It is divided into four quadrants, including sections such as project objectives, technical approach, activity diagram, and the schedule. This format is designed to provide decision-makers with a clear, high-level overview of the project at a glance.

Additionally a short video discussing the project overview, proposed design and methodology is as below:
